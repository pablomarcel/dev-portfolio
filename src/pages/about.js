        <p>This Web App is my Developer Portfolio I built using Gatsby based off a starter project. My Journey to Software Development started back in 2021 when I enrolled in a Python Certificate Program. Python has given me unlimited joy and entertainment because of its versatility, simplicity and ease of use. Learning Python was like discovering gems in a treasure chest every day. I’ve included projects of any size in this portfolio because they were all stimulating. I also want to pass along the message that Software Development is fun, can be started at anytime and anybody can do it. Developers can start small and build from there. </p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2022, I enrolled in a Full Stack Certificate Program. Even though Python, Django and Flask are fabulous, the web runs on Javascript. So, history repeated itself. React gave me unlimited joy and entertainment. In a short period of time, it allowed me to build full blown Web Apps. I also enjoyed working on the backend with tools like node, express, mongoose, GraphQL and MongoDB. </p>
        <p>Knowing a general purpose programming language helped me to easily pick up others like C# and Swift. In this portfolio I’ve also included Unity games that are deployed to itch.io. Unity was the excuse I needed to Learn C#. Finally, I will include iOS projects at a later date. </p>
