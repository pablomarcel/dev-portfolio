        <p>This is my Portfolio App developed using Gatsby. My Journey through Software Development started back in 2021 when I enrolled in a Python Certificate Program. Python has given me unlimited joy and entertainment because of its versatility, simplicity and ease of use. Learning Python was like discovering gems in a treasure chest every day. I’ve included projects of any size in this portfolio because they were all stimulating. I also want to pass along the message that Software Development is fun, can be started at anytime and anybody can do it. Developers can start small and build from there. </p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2022, I enrolled in a Full Stack Certificate Program. Even though Python, Django and Flask are fabulous, the web runs on Javascript. So, history repeated itself. Learning React gave me unlimited joy and entertainment. React allowed me to build full blown Web Apps in a short period of time. I also enjoyed working on the backend with tools like Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, GraphQL, Apollo and MongoDB. </p>
        <p>Knowing a general purpose programming language helped me to easily pick C# and Swift. In this portfolio I’ve also included Unity games. Unity was the excuse I needed to Learn C#. Finally, I will include iOS projects at a later date. </p>
