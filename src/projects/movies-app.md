### Project Description

Overview

Movies Database is a React App that displays a list of movie titles. Each movie title is clickable and can reveal more information about the movie.
The App uses GraphQL under the hood to query information about the movies and Apollo middleware to handle the communication between React and GraphQL.

How React App Displays Movies Data

The movies database is stored in MongoDB. The App is deployed in Heroku. When a user clicks on a movie title, a details section is displayed with information about the genre, director and other movies by the same director.
The details section is powered by the GraphQL query and Apollo middleware, which fetches the movie data from the MongoDB database and displays it in the React App.

Using GraphQL and Apollo Middleware

Using GraphQL and Apollo middleware makes it easier for the user to query data from the database and display it in the React App. This makes the user experience more efficient and enjoyable.
The GraphQL query is more efficient than traditional SQL queries and Apollo middleware ensures that the data is transferred securely between React and GraphQL.

Storing Movies Data in MongoDB

The movies database is stored in MongoDB, which is a document-oriented database. This makes it easier to store and query data from the database.
MongoDB also allows for scalability, making it easier to add more data to the database as needed.

Deploying the App in Heroku

The App is deployed in Heroku, which is a cloud platform for hosting applications. Heroku allows for easy deployment and scaling of the application.
Heroku also ensures that the App is always running and up to date, making it easier for the user to access the App at any time.

Conclusion

Movies Database is a React App that displays a list of movie titles. The App uses GraphQL and Apollo middleware to query data from the MongoDB database, which is stored in Heroku.
Using GraphQL, Apollo middleware, MongoDB and Heroku makes the user experience more efficient and enjoyable. The App is always up to date, making it easier for the user to access the App at any time.
