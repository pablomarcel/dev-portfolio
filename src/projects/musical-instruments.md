### Project Description

Musical Instruments is a web app that showcases a variety of musical instruments. It is built using Next.js, a popular framework for building server-rendered React apps, and integrates with Contentful, a content management platform, to manage and organize the media content for the instruments.

On the main page, users can view thumbnail images, titles, and links to the details page for each instrument review. When a user clicks on a link, they are taken to the details page for that instrument, which displays a picture of the instrument as well as information about its type, attributes, and description.

The pictures for the instruments are hosted in Contentful, as this service makes it easy to manage media files and add additional information such as titles, slugs, descriptions, and more.

The app is hosted on Vercel, a service that offers seamless continuous deployment and excellent performance.
