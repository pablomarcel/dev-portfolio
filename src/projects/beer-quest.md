### Project Description

Introducing Beer Quest, a web application powered by the Open Brewery Database and built with JavaScript. The Open Brewery Database is a free, public dataset and API with information on breweries nationwide, which can be accessed at [**Open Brewery Database API**](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/). With Beer Quest, users can search for breweries by inputting a state, city, and page number. Upon submitting the form, the app fetches the data from the API and displays a list of 5 breweries, including their Name, City, and Website. Users can view additional results by adjusting the page number or choose to export the results to a JSON file. The app features a sleek user interface designed with Bootstrap and is hosted on DigitalOcean.

### System Requirements
