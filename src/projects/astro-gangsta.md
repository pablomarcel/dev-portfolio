### Project Details

Exploring the Spaceship
The astronaut floats through the ship, taking in the sights of the metallic walls and the blinking lights.
The journey is not without hazards, as the astronaut must avoid the acid pools and the moving platforms to traverse the ship.

Collecting the Keycard
The astronaut must locate a keycard to unlock a door and capture the goal.
The card is hidden in a secret room, guarded by an alien creature.

Power-Ups and Extra Lives
The astronaut can collect power-ups to give them an advantage in their mission.
Extra lives can also be found to help the astronaut in their quest.

Fighting Aliens
The astronaut must fight off aliens in order to progress through the ship.
The aliens come in all shapes and sizes, from small and weak to large and powerful.

Unlocking the Door
The astronaut must use the keycard to unlock the door and capture the goal.
Once the door is open, the astronaut can complete the level and move on to the next one.

Completing the Level
Once the goal is captured, the astronaut can complete the level.
The astronaut can then move on to the next level and continue their mission.
