### Project Description

Introduction

Flask Donations is an app that displays a list of monetary contributions and their corresponding donor's name, sorted by date.
The app also provides the ability to create a donation, but users must first exist in order to do so. When a new donation is created, the list is automatically updated.

Frontend Styling

The frontend of Flask Donations is kept simple and clean, using basic styling to ensure a pleasant user experience.
The app is hosted on Heroku, so it can be accessed from anywhere in the world.

Creating a Donation

To create a donation, the user must first exist within the app. The user can then enter the donation amount and the donor's name.
Once the donation is created, the list is automatically updated with the new donation, and the user is notified of their successful contribution.

Updating the List

Once a donation is created, the list of donations is automatically updated with the new donation.
The list is sorted by inverted date, so the newest donations appear at the bottom.

Conclusion

Flask Donations is an app that provides users with an easy way to track and manage donations. It is hosted on Heroku and is accessible from anywhere in the world.
The app is kept simple and clean, using basic styling to ensure a pleasant user experience.
