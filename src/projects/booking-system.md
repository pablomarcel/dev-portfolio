### Project Description

Overview

Booking System is a Python console app that uses object orientation to manage a booking system for the shipping of goods.
The user can book a shipment, display all bookings, display cost, shipping option, weight and volume statistics about all bookings.

Viewing Bookings

When the user chooses the option to display all the bookings, the app generates a table with information about the booking ID, name, contents, weight, volume, delivery date, shipping method, and cost.
The app uses [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) under the hood to manage and display the tabular data.

Statistics

Pandas is also used to handle the statistics about cost, shipping option, volume and weight.
The app can generate reports and graphs that show the total cost, the most popular shipping option, the total weight and volume of all bookings, and more.

Booking a Shipment

Booking a shipment is a straightforward process. The user simply needs to enter the details of the shipment, such as the name, contents, weight, and delivery date.
The app then calculates the cost, and generates a unique booking ID that can be used to track the shipment.

Tracking Shipments

The app allows the user to track shipments using the unique booking ID. The user can enter the ID, and the app will display the details of the shipment, including the name, contents, weight, delivery date, shipping method, and cost.
The app also allows the user to update the details of the shipment, such as the delivery date or shipping method.

Conclusion

Booking System is a powerful and easy-to-use app that allows users to quickly and easily book shipments, track them, and view statistics about all of their bookings.
The app is written in Python, and uses object orientation to manage the bookings, and Pandas to generate reports and graphs. The app is an invaluable tool for anyone who needs to manage their shipments quickly and efficiently.
