### Project Description

This app prints a grid based off the user specifications. The user is given the option to specify the number of rows and columns. 
The program then builds a grid with ASCII characters.

A variant of the [**Grid Printer**](https://zingy-griffin-c00a53.netlify.app/) is deployed in Netlify. I used [**PyScript**](https://pyscript.net/) to experiment with Python in the Browser.

### System Requirements

Software: Python, PyScript, Netlify
