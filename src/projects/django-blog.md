### Project Description

Django Blog is a dynamic web application that allows you to view and interact with a variety of engaging blog posts and polls. The app is powered by Django, a powerful backend framework that enables the creation and management of user accounts, categories, and content.

Through a sleek user interface designed with simple Bootstrap, you can easily navigate the app and access its various features. A convenient nav bar at the top of the page allows you to login and authenticate using either your GitHub account or email address. Once you've completed the login process, you'll be greeted with a friendly "Hello User" message in the nav bar.

The administrator of this app has the ability to create and publish blog posts, assigning them to a specific category and including an author and post date. The blog posts themselves are just simple text, allowing you to share thoughts and ideas with ease. In addition to blog posts, the app also features polls, which consist of a title and text for users to vote on.

Overall, Django Blog is a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that provides an enjoyable experience for both readers and creators. The app is deployed on the reliable Heroku platform, ensuring its accessibility and stability. Thank you for using Django Blog!
