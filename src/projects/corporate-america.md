### Project Description

Corporate BuzzWords is a web application that showcases catch phrases commonly used in the business world. 
The app features two main routes: allPhrases and the root route. The allPhrases route displays all phrases submitted by all users, while the root route only displays the phrases submitted by the currently logged in user. 
Email authentication is implemented for a more immersive experience and the root route is protected by JWT authentication. If you're logged in, you can view a form to submit your own favorite phrases and edit them in the personal section. However, you are not able to edit phrases when viewing the allPhrases route. 
The app uses a MongoDB database with Mongoose middleware for Object Data Modeling and has an Express.js backend with a React frontend. The app is deployed on Heroku.

### System Requirements

Software: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React, Node, JWT
