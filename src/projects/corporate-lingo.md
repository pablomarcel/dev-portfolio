### Project Description

Overview

The app displays data about popular corporate phrases, using a Next.js framework for routing and tooling, a Netlify Function for authorization, and MongoDB for data storage.

Netlify Identity Authentication

Netlify Identity provides secure user authentication for the app. It supports external providers such as Google or GitHub, as well as custom email and password logins.
This allows users to access the app with their existing credentials, while allowing the app to maintain control and security over user data.

Next.js Framework

The Next.js framework handles the routing and tooling for the app. It is a popular React-based framework that is used for building dynamic web applications.
It allows for fast development and deployment of the app, while providing a secure and reliable platform for user data.

Netlify Function

The Netlify Function is used to authorize the connection to the database, ensuring that only valid users can access the data.
It is a powerful tool that allows for secure and efficient authorization, while providing a seamless user experience.

MongoDB Database

The MongoDB database is used to store the data about the catch phrases, including the title, the company, and the state.
It is a powerful and reliable database that allows for secure storage of user data, while providing efficient access to the data.

Deployment in Netlify

The app is deployed in Netlify, a popular platform for hosting web applications. It provides a secure and reliable hosting environment for the app.
Netlify also provides powerful tools for deployment, such as automated builds and deploys, as well as easy integration with Netlify Identity for authentication.
